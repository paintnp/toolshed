# CODEBASE STRUCTURE MAP - REFERENCE BEFORE GENERATING CODE

This is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the existing codebase. Before writing or modifying any code, carefully review this structure to:

1. PREVENT DUPLICATION: Do not recreate existing functions, classes, or utilities
2. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: Follow existing naming conventions, patterns, and architectural decisions
3. LEVERAGE EXISTING CODE: Utilize and extend current functionality rather than reimplementing it
4. UNDERSTAND DEPENDENCIES: Note relationships between components before introducing changes
5. RESPECT INTERFACES: Ensure new code maintains compatibility with existing APIs and class contracts

Each file section contains signatures and docstrings (no implementation details) of all classes, methods, and functions.

When asked to modify or extend the codebase:
- First identify relevant existing components in this map
- Reference the appropriate file paths, class names, and function signatures
- Build upon the established architecture rather than creating parallel implementations
- Maintain consistent style, parameter naming, and return types

IMPORTANT: Ignoring this structure will likely result in incompatible code, redundant implementations, namespace collisions, and architectural inconsistencies.
