Dynamic ECS Task Definition Registration for ToolShed Pipeline
Step 1: Add ECS Task Definition Registration State
Cursor Prompt Text: In ValidationPipelineStack.ts, import the Step Functions tasks module and define a new Step Functions state to dynamically register an ECS task definition for the ToolShed validation container. Use CDK’s CallAwsService construct to call the ECS registerTaskDefinition API, which allows using the image URI from the state input. Set the task family to "ToolShedValidation" and use the image URI from the Step Functions input ($.imageDetails.imageUri) as the container image. Provide Fargate configuration (network mode awsvpc, RequiresCompatibilities: FARGATE, and appropriate CPU/memory) along with the existing ECS task execution role ARN and task role ARN. Capture the response so the new task definition ARN can be used in subsequent steps. For example:
typescript
Copy
import { aws_stepfunctions as sfn, aws_stepfunctions_tasks as tasks } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
// ... (within ValidationPipelineStack)

const registerTask = new tasks.CallAwsService(this, 'RegisterValidationTaskDef', {
  service: 'ecs',
  action: 'registerTaskDefinition',
  parameters: {
    Family: 'ToolShedValidation',
    NetworkMode: 'awsvpc',
    RequiresCompatibilities: ['FARGATE'],
    Cpu: '256',            // 0.25 vCPU (adjust if needed)
    Memory: '512',         // 0.5 GB (adjust if needed)
    ExecutionRoleArn: '<EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN>',  // replace with actual ECS task execution role ARN
    TaskRoleArn: '<TASK_ROLE_ARN>',            // replace with actual ECS task role ARN
    ContainerDefinitions: [{
      Name: 'ValidationContainer',
      Image: sfn.JsonPath.stringAt('$.imageDetails.imageUri'),
      Essential: true,
      Memory: 512        // container memory in MiB (adjust as needed)
      // Include environment variables, command, or log configuration here if required
    }]
  },
  resultPath: '$.registeredTask',
  iamResources: ['*']    // allow calling ECS APIs (limit scope to specific resources if possible)
});
This registerTask step will create a new revision in the ToolShedValidation task definition family using the provided image URI​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. Note: Ensure the Step Functions execution role has permission to call ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition and to pass the specified IAM roles. In particular, add an IAM policy allowing iam:PassRole for the ECS task execution role and task role, since Step Functions needs to pass these roles when registering the task​
DOCS.AWS.AMAZON.COM
. Testing Prompt: Deploy the CDK stack and execute the Step Functions state machine with a test input containing an imageDetails.imageUri (e.g., an ECR image URI produced by CodeBuild). Verify that the Step Functions execution succeeds on the RegisterValidationTaskDef state. In the AWS ECS console, you should see a new task definition revision under the ToolShedValidation family using the provided image URI. The Step Functions execution output for the register step (in $.registeredTask) should include details of the new task definition, including its ARN and revision number, confirming that dynamic task registration is working.
Step 2: Add ECS RunTask State using the New Task Definition
Cursor Prompt Text: Next, create a Step Functions state to run the ECS task with the newly registered task definition. Use CallAwsService for the ECS runTask action. Specify the ECS cluster, launch type FARGATE, and networking details, and reference the task definition ARN from the output of the previous state. For example, add the following in ValidationPipelineStack.ts (after defining registerTask above):
typescript
Copy
const runTask = new tasks.CallAwsService(this, 'RunValidationTask', {
  service: 'ecs',
  action: 'runTask',
  parameters: {
    Cluster: cluster.clusterArn,  // your ECS cluster ARN
    TaskDefinition: sfn.JsonPath.stringAt('$.registeredTask.taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn'),
    LaunchType: 'FARGATE',
    NetworkConfiguration: {
      AwsvpcConfiguration: {
        Subnets: vpc.selectSubnets({ subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS }).subnetIds,
        SecurityGroups: [ validationSG.securityGroupId ],
        AssignPublicIp: 'ENABLED'
      }
    }
  },
  resultPath: '$.runResult',
  iamResources: ['*']
});
In this runTask step, we pass the Cluster ARN, the TaskDefinition ARN from the registerTask output, and the required network configuration for Fargate. We use an AWS VPC configuration (subnet IDs and a security group) to ensure the task launches in the correct subnets and with the proper security group. The Step Functions state will call ECS to start the task on Fargate​
DOCS.AWS.AMAZON.COM
. Make sure to replace cluster, vpc, and validationSG with your actual cluster, VPC, and security group objects or IDs. The result of this state (stored in $.runResult) will contain details of the started task (including the tasks[0].taskArn). Chain the states so that runTask executes after registerTask. For example, you can define your state machine sequence as:
typescript
Copy
// ... after defining registerTask and runTask:
const workflowChain = registerTask.next(runTask);
This ensures the state machine will first register the task definition, then immediately start the task using that definition. Testing Prompt: Deploy the updated stack and run the state machine with a test image URI input. After execution, confirm that a new ECS task has been launched on your cluster. You can check the ECS Tasks tab for your cluster to see the running task. It should be using the latest ToolShedValidation task definition revision that was just created. The Step Functions execution’s output ($.runResult) should include the task information (e.g. a tasks[0].taskArn and status). This verifies that the workflow successfully started a Fargate task with the dynamic task definition. (You should see the task in RUNNING status in ECS, indicating the container is up.)
Step 3: Chain a Lambda Validation Step After Starting the Task
Cursor Prompt Text: Now, add a Step Functions step to hand off control to a Lambda function (or another processing task) after the ECS task has been started. This Lambda (e.g., a “ToolShed validator” function) can perform validation or monitoring while the ECS task runs. Use the Step Functions Lambda invoke integration to call the function. For example, if you have a Lambda function defined as validatorFn in the stack, add:
typescript
Copy
const validateStep = new tasks.LambdaInvoke(this, 'InvokeValidatorLambda', {
  lambdaFunction: validatorFn,
  payload: sfn.TaskInput.fromObject({
    imageUri: sfn.JsonPath.stringAt('$.imageDetails.imageUri'),
    taskArn: sfn.JsonPath.stringAt('$.runResult.tasks[0].taskArn')
  }),
  resultPath: '$.validationOutput'
});
This validateStep will invoke the Lambda function, passing along the image URI and the ECS task ARN (from the runTask result) as input. Now extend the state machine chain to include this step after the task launch:
typescript
Copy
workflowChain.next(validateStep);
(If you defined workflowChain as in the previous step, it would become registerTask.next(runTask).next(validateStep)). At this point, the Step Functions workflow is: Register ECS TaskDefinition -> Run ECS Task -> Invoke Validator Lambda. Because we used the direct AWS SDK integration (without the .sync suffix on runTask), the state machine does not wait for the ECS task to finish – it proceeds to the Lambda as soon as the task is started. This satisfies the requirement to “pass control” to the next step once the ECS task is running. (In the future, if you need to wait for the container to complete, you could implement a callback or poll for task completion, but that’s outside our current scope.) Testing Prompt: After adding the Lambda step, deploy the stack and execute the state machine again with a test input. Verify that the state machine now runs through all three steps: it registers the task definition, starts the ECS task, and then invokes the Lambda function. Check the Lambda’s CloudWatch logs or output to confirm it was invoked with the expected payload (it should log/receive the image URI and ECS task ARN passed in). This confirms that control is successfully handed off to the Lambda validator immediately after the ECS task starts.
Step 4: Update State Machine Definition and Clean Up Static Configuration
Cursor Prompt Text: Finally, update the state machine definition in the CDK to use the new dynamic steps and remove any now-unneeded static configuration. If your stack previously defined a static ecs.TaskDefinition or used a Step Functions EcsRunTask state with a fixed image, you can delete those, as they are replaced by the dynamic registerTask and runTask steps. Ensure the state machine’s definition is set to the new sequence. For example, when instantiating the State Machine, use:
typescript
Copy
const stateMachine = new sfn.StateMachine(this, 'ToolShedValidationStateMachine', {
  definition: registerTask.next(runTask).next(validateStep),
  timeout: cdk.Duration.minutes(15),
  role: stateMachineRole, // (ensure this role has necessary permissions as noted above)
  // ... other props like state machine name, if any
});
Make sure that any references to the old task definition or container image are removed or replaced with the new logic. The IAM role used by the state machine should already have the needed permissions (ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition, ecs:RunTask, and iam:PassRole for the roles) from earlier steps. The ECS cluster and security group resources remain as before, and no changes are needed for them besides using them in the new states. Testing Prompt: Perform a fresh cdk synth to ensure the CloudFormation template reflects the new state machine definition (you should see the CallAwsService and Lambda invoke states in the JSON definition, and no lingering static ECS task definitions). Deploy the updated stack. Then trigger a full execution of the ToolShedValidation state machine with a sample input (containing the imageDetails.imageUri). Confirm the following expected outcomes:
A new ECS Task Definition revision is created in the ToolShedValidation family with the specified Docker image URI.
An ECS task is started on the cluster using that new task definition. (You can verify the task’s details in the ECS console, confirming it’s running the expected image.)
The workflow transitions to the Lambda validator step after the task is launched. The Lambda should run (check its logs/output) and handle whatever validation logic is needed.
The Step Functions execution completes successfully after the Lambda step.
By verifying the above, you confirm that the ECS task indeed runs with the expected image URI and that the pipeline seamlessly hands off control to the next validation step once the container is running. The ToolShed validation pipeline is now using dynamic ECS task registration as intended, allowing each execution to deploy and run against a fresh container image.
